# Top 3 Platform Engineering Objectives for 2025

## Agenda

- Enhanced Developer Experience & Productivity
- Platform as a Product with FinOps Integration
- Implementing Robust Security & Compliance Automation

## Objective 1: Enhance Developer Experience & Productivity

**Why It Matters:**

- Developers spend 40% of time on infrastructure setup instead of coding, directly impacting business agility
- High cognitive load reduces innovation and efficiency
- Inconsistent development environments lead to "works on my machine" problems
