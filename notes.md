# Top 3 Platform Engineering Objectives for 2025

## Agenda

- Enhanced Developer Experionce & Productivity
- Platfrom as a Product with FinOps integration
- Implementing Robust Security & Compliance Autoamtion

## Objective 1: Enhance Developer Experience & Productvity

**Why It Matters:**

- Developers spend time on other tasks like infrastructure setjup instead odf codeing. Directly impacting business agility and time-to-market
- High cognitive load reducnes innovation and efficiency

    style J fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:white
```

**Key Initiatives:**

- Implement internal developer portals with comprehensive self-service capabilities
- Deploy real-time cost visibility dashboards for all engineering teams
- Create automated resource optimization recommendations
- Establish clear platform product roadmaps with stakeholder feedback loops

**Potential Benefits/Measures:**

- 90% platform adoption across engineering teams
- 20% reduction in cloud spend without sacrificing performance
- 50% decrease in platform-related support tickets
- Consistent positive feedback in quarterly platform NPS scores
