# Agile GitHub Release Management Process

## Overview
This document outlines an Agile-based release management process using GitHub, designed to support iterative development, continuous delivery, and sprint-based workflows.

## Agile Release Planning

### Release Trains
- Two-week sprint cycles aligned with team iterations
- Monthly release trains for production deployments
- Continuous delivery pipeline for feature flags and dark launches
- Emergency hotfix process for critical issues

### Planning Hierarchy
1. **Portfolio Level**
   - Quarterly release planning
   - Major feature roadmap
   - Strategic alignment

2. **Program Level**
   - Monthly release trains
   - Cross-team dependencies
   - Feature completion tracking

3. **Team Level**
   - Two-week sprints
   - Daily deployments to staging
   - Continuous integration

## Sprint Workflow

### Sprint Planning
1. **Backlog Refinement**
   - Review and prioritize issues
   - Break down user stories
   - Assign story points
   - Tag issues for upcoming sprint

2. **Sprint Board Setup**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflow/sprint-board.yml
   name: Sprint Board Automation
   on:
     issues:
       types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled]
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, closed]

   jobs:
     update_sprint_board:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/github-project-automation@v1
         with:
           project: "Sprint Board"
           column: "To Do"
           repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

### Daily Development Process
1. **Morning Stand-up**
   - Review GitHub project board
   - Update issue statuses
   - Identify blockers

2. **Development Flow**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
     A[Sprint Backlog] --> B[Feature Branch]
     B --> C[PR Review]
     C --> D[Develop Branch]
     D --> E[Integration Tests]
     E --> F[Staging Deploy]
     F --> G[UAT]
     G --> H[Release Candidate]
   ```

3. **Continuous Integration**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflow/sprint-ci.yml
   name: Sprint CI
   on:
     pull_request:
       branches: [ develop ]
     push:
       branches: [ feature/*, bugfix/* ]

   jobs:
     sprint-validation:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         
         - name: Run Sprint Tests
           uses: ./.github/actions/run-tests
           with:
             coverage-threshold: ${{ vars.SPRINT_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD }}
             
         - name: Feature Flag Validation
           run: |
             ./scripts/validate-feature-flags.sh
             
         - name: Update Sprint Metrics
           uses: ./.github/actions/update-sprint-metrics
   ```

## Feature Flag Management

### Feature Flag Configuration
```json
{
  "featureFlags": {
    "newFeature": {
      "enabled": false,
      "rolloutPercentage": 0,
      "sprint": "Sprint 23",
      "owner": "team-platform",
      "metrics": [
        "adoption_rate",
        "error_rate"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Feature Toggle Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflow/feature-toggle.yml
name: Feature Toggle Management
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      feature_name:
        required: true
      action:
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - enable
          - disable
          - rollback

jobs:
  toggle_feature:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Toggle Feature
        uses: ./.github/actions/feature-toggle
        with:
          feature: ${{ github.event.inputs.feature_name }}
          action: ${{ github.event.inputs.action }}
          
      - name: Monitor Feature Health
        uses: ./.github/actions/feature-health-check
```
